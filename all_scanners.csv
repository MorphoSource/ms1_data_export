The new large format cooled x-ray digital camera achieves high spatial resolution without compromising sample size. Fast scan and reconstruction throughput is supported by a computer cluster option, which reconstructs scan datasets in less time than the scan duration in most cases, using several PCs in parallel. Cross section images are generated in a wide range of formats up to 8k x 8k pixels.

Because the height of the scan field is equivalent to its width, high-aspect-ratio specimens must generally be scanned in contiguous parts and the parts then matched together. The microXCT scanner features a Hamamatsu X-ray source capable of energies from 40 to 150 kV. The detectors are mounted on microscope objectives with magnifications ranging from 0.4X to 40X; the former yields a field of view of ~55 mm, whereas the latter yields ~0.5 mm. Thus the spatial resolution for the microXCT ranges from ~55 µm to less than 1 µm. The microXCT scanner also offers the advantage of enhanced phase contrast to better image materials with low mean atomic numbers such as soft tissues and polymers.",39,1474375512,Zeiss (Xradia) microXCT 400,12

65,0,1465845174,"The GE v|tome|x system is a dual-tube system equipped with a 300kV unipolar microfocus X-ray tube, a 180kV nanofocus X-ray tube with transmission target assembly, and a GE DXR250 high-contrast digital flat panel detector. The high-energy xs|300 d unipolar 300kV, 500W X-ray tube uses a tungsten reflection target system. This Xray tube allows CT imaging of a range of object sizes and densities at high-resolution with a maximum feature detectability of 1 mm. The xs|300 d unipolar allows for the flexibility of conducting both low energy, high-resolution scanning and higher energy scanning for larger, denser objects. The system is also equipped with a second tube, the xs|180nf 180kV, 15W nanofocus X-ray tube. The xs|180nf uses a transmission target system to achieve nanofocus with detail detectabilities in the sub-500 nm range. The xs|180nf also uses a diamond exit window that greatly enhances data quality compared to the more common beryllium windows. The nanofocus tube includes both tungsten and molybdenum target assemblies. Molydenum targets optimize the X-ray spectrum at low acceleration voltages and enhance detectability of low density, soft materials like soft biological tissue. The v|tome|x L 300 uses a high-contrast GE DXR|250|HCD 4 megapixel (2048x2048) digital flat panel detector. This detector is mounted on a track and is automatically translated laterally so that the detector field can be doubled. This so-called “virtual detector” effectively increases the available pixel field to 4096 wide by 2048 high. The increased pixel field allows a much larger projection image to be collected so that maximum resolutions for scanning increase to approximately 1/4000th the diameter of the object being scanned.",55,1465845174,GE v|tome|x L300 multi-scale nano/microCT sys,132

The micro-focus source is an X-Tek 225 kV, 225W tube with a nominal focal spot size of about 5 mm at 5W. The higher-power source is a Pantak 1600W sealed x-ray tube capable of 320 kV with the minimum focal spot of >100 mm. The OMNI-X is capable of continuously variable magnification with pixel sizes approximately 1/1000th of the sample diameter. The strength of the HD-600 is the flexibility to image objects ranging in size from 10 mm to 200 mm with a variety of material densities.",55,1465845174,Varian BIR HD-600 OMNI-X multi-scale industri,132

    Adaptive Array Detector (AAD) system based on UFCTM (Ultrafast Ceramics) with 26880 elements in 40 rows, 1344 channels per slice and up to 4640 projections per 360° rotation.
    Up to 40 images per rotation of below 0.6 mm isotropic resolution.
    STRATON tube high-performance X-ray system provide direct cooling of the anode with the ball bearings located outside the vacuum.  The direct anode cooling and the small and compact design of the anode plate (120 mm diameter) eliminates the need for heat storage capacity (0 MHU) and enables an unprecedented cooling rate of 5.0 MHU/min.  Therefore, cooling delays between multiple long range scans are eliminated, even for large patients.
    The STRATON X-ray tube utilizes an electron beam that is accurately and rapidly deflected, creating two precise focal spots alternating 4640 times per second.  This doubles the X-ray projections reaching each detector element.  The two overlapping projections result in an oversampling in z-direction, known as Double z-Sampling.  The resulting measurements interleave half a detector slice width, doubling the scan information without a corresponding increase in dose.  Siemens’ high-speed UFCTM detector enables a virtually simultaneous readout of two projections for each detector element – 2 x 20 slices for every viewing angle – resulting in a full 40-slice acquisition.
